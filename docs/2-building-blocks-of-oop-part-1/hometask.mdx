# 7. 📚 Home Task

import { TableForMentors } from '@site/src/components';

The home task should be done using TypeScript.

:::info
The starter code for the home task is located in _docs/2-building-blocks-of-oop-part-1/hometask_ folder
:::

## Specific Steps

1. Create a `Point` class, which creates 2-dimensional point with coordinates. It
   should contain:
  - two instance variables `x` and `y`;
  - default constructor which creates a point at the location of (0, 0);
  - overloaded constructor (use multiple constructors declaration for Typescript)
    which creates a point by `x` and `y` coordinates;
  - `toString()` method should return a `Point` class stringified representation in
    format: `"(x, y)"`;
  - `distance()` method should be overloaded (use multiple methods declaration for
    Typescript) with next implementations:
    - no args: distance from this point to (0, 0);
    - `distance(other: Point)` - distance from this point to a given instance of
      `Point`;
    - `distance(x, y)` - distance from this point to a given point (x, y).

2. Create abstract superclass called `Shape`, which contains:
  - two protected instance variables: `color` (string), `filled`
    (boolean) and `points` (Point[]);
  - overloaded constructor (use multiple constructors declaration for Typescript): a
    constructor that takes a list of `points` and initializes the color to `"green"`
    and filled to `true` by default, and a constructor that takes a list of `points`,
    the `color` and `filled` properties;
  - Make sure that the `Shape` has at least 3 points (2 points is just a line).
  - `toString()` method that returns `"A Shape with color of xxx and filled/Not
    filled. Points: (x1, y1), (x2, y2)..."`;
  - `getPerimeter()` that calculates the perimeter using `Point.distance` method;

3. Create class `Triangle` that takes 3 points as it's vertices. Triangle must inherit
   `Shape` abstract class. `Triangle` should contain:

  - a constructor (use multiple constructors declaration for Typescript) which creates
    `Triangle` class using three instances of `Point` class, may also provide color and
    filled properties;
  - override `toString()` method, it should return a `Triangle` class stringified
    representation in format `"Triangle[v1=(x1, y1),v2=(x2, y2),v3=(x3, y3)]"`;
  - override `getType()` method, which prints `"equilateral triangle"` if all the three
    sides are equal, `"isosceles triangle"` if any two of the three sides are equal, or
    `"scalene triangle"` if all sides are different.
